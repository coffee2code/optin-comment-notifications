Allows users to opt into receiving a notification email whenever a comment is made to the site.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a checkbox to the profile page for users which allows them to opt into receiving a notification email whenever a comment is made to the site.

If a comment goes into moderation, only users who have the ability to manage comments on the site will receive the moderation notification email.

By default, all users of the site have the ability to subscribe to notifications about comments. A filter is provided to facilitate use of code to customize the feature's availability to users.

Note: a "user" is a person with an actual login account for the site. The plugin does not facilitate permitting visitors who do not have an account on the site to be able to subscribe to all comments.

== Installation ==

1. Install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer. Or download and unzip `optin-comment-notifications.zip` inside the plugins directory for your site (typically `wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
3. Users wishing to opt into receiving notifications for new comments should visit their profile page and check the checkbox labeled "Email me whenever a comment is submitted to the site."


== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of the checkbox added to user profiles.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can sign up to receive notifications about comments to the site? =

Any user account on the site can sign up for comment notifications. Comments that go into moderation will only trigger notifications to users who can moderate comments. Visitors who do not have an account on the site cannot make use of the plugin to subscribe to comments.

= How do I sign up to receive notifications? =

On your profile page, there is a checkbox next to "New Comment Emails" that is labeled "Email me whenever a comment is submitted to the site.". Check the checkbox and click the button to update your profile. If you wish to discontinue receiving such notifications, simply uncheck the checkbox and save the change.

= Does this plugin include unit tests? =

Yes.

= How can I restrict the plugin to only offer the ability to subscribe to all comments to administrators and editors? =

Use the 'c2c_optin_comment_notifications_has_cap' filter to customize the capability as needed. The following code can be used or adapted for that purpose. Such code should ideally be put into a mu-plugin or site-specific plugin (which is beyond the scope of this readme to explain).

`
/**
 * Only permits administrators and editors to subscribe to comment notifications.
 *
 * @param bool  $default The default. Default true.
 * @param array $caps    Array of user capabilities.
 * @return string
 */
function restrict_optin_comment_notifications( $default, $caps ) {
	// Only administrators and editors can subscribe to all comments.
	return !! array_intersect(
		wp_get_current_user()->roles,      // Get current user's roles.
		array( 'administrator', 'editor' ) // Roles to allow to subscribe to all comments.
	);
}
add_filter( 'c2c_optin_comment_notifications_has_cap', 'restrict_optin_comment_notifications', 10, 2 );
`

= Can an administrator configure the setting for another user? =

Yes. Users with the 'edit_users' capability (administrators, basically) and can edit the profile of another user can configure this plugin for that user. The checkbox is labeled "Email this user whenever a comment is submitted to the site.".
